**# Cognifyz Technologies — Data Analysis Internship Project

This repository contains my complete work for the **Cognifyz Technologies Data Analysis Internship**, covering all three levels of data analysis using Power BI and Python.

## 📊 Project Overview
The goal was to explore restaurant data to uncover insights about cuisines, pricing, delivery options, and customer ratings.

### 🔹 Level 1 — Basic Analysis
- Top 3 Cuisines and their distribution  
- City with most restaurants  
- Average rating per city  
- Price range analysis  
- Online delivery comparison  

### 🔹 Level 2 — Intermediate Analysis
- Most common cuisine combinations  
- Geographic restaurant distribution (map view)  
- Restaurant chain identification  

### 🔹 Level 3 — Advanced Analysis
- Votes and ratings correlation  
- Highest & lowest voted restaurants  
- Relationship between price range, online delivery, and table booking  

## 🧠 Key Insights

- **City with most restaurants:** New Delhi  
- **Most common rating range:** 3.0 – 3.5  
- **Votes–Rating correlation:** 0.31 (moderate positive)  
- **Premium restaurants** offer more table booking than online delivery  

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** for dashboards  
- **Python (pandas, matplotlib)** for data analysis  
- **Excel / CSV** for preprocessing  
- **GitHub** for version control
